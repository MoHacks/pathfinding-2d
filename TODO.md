------------------------------------
Once completed the project, add the following features:

1. Create a header that:
    - allows the user to select the grid row and column size (up to 50x50)
    -  

2. Allow the user to make the grid more aesthetically pleasing (i.e. with colors, etc.)
3. Allow for multiple squares to be the end destination and the algorithm should choose the destination square that is closest to the start
4. Also finish DFS (using Stack Data Structure), Weighted Dijkstra, and A* pathfinding algorithms
5. If time permits:
    - Refactor CSS to use TailwindCSS instead
    - refactor using Hooks
    - refactor everything into Typescript, but push the Javascript Version onto a branch in Gihub first!
